          <h1>Bjorneo Terms of Service</h1>
        <p>Last Updated:  December 10, 2012.  The following describes the terms on which Bjorneo offers you access to our sites, services, and tools (including, but not limited to, applications).</p>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Welcome to Bjorneo.  By using Bjorneo (including bjorneo.com and its related sites, services and tools), you agree to the following terms with Bjorneo Inc. and the general principles for the websites of our subsidiaries and international affiliates.  </p>
        <p>This Agreement is effective on December 10, 2012, for current users, and upon acceptance for new users.  You accept this User Agreement by clicking the Submit button when registering an Bjorneo account; accessing or using Bjorneo's sites, services, and tools; or as otherwise indicated on a specific site, service, or tool. </p>
        <p>Please be advised: This User Agreement contains provisions that govern how claims you and we have against each other are resolved (see Limitation of Liability and Legal Disputes Sections below).  It also contains an Agreement to Arbitrate, which will, with limited exception, require you to submit claims you have against us to binding and final arbitration, unless you opt-out of the Agreement to Arbitrate (see Legal Disputes, Section B ("Agreement to Arbitrate")).  Unless you opt-out: (1) you will only be permitted to pursue claims against Bjorneo on an individual basis, not as part of any class or representative action or proceeding and (2) you will only be permitted to seek relief (including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief) on an individual basis.</p>
        <h3>Scope</h3>
        <p>Before you may become a member of Bjorneo, you must read and accept all of the terms in, and linked to, this User Agreement and the Bjorneo Privacy Policy.  We strongly recommend that, as you read this User Agreement, you also access and read the linked information.  By accepting this User Agreement, you agree that this User Agreement and Privacy Policy will apply whenever you use Bjorneo sites or services, or when you use the tools that are made available to interact with Bjorneo sites and services.  Some Bjorneo sites, services, and tools may have additional or other terms, agreements, or policies that govern their availability and use.  Your use of and access to such sites, services, and tools are subject to any and all terms, agreements, or policies applicable to them.</p>

          <li>fail to deliver items purchased from you, unless the buyer fails to meet the posted terms, or you cannot reach the buyer;</li>
          <li>manipulate the price of any item or interfere with other users' listings;</li>

          <li>circumvent any Bjorneo policy or determinations about your account status such as temporary or indefinite suspensions or other account holds, limitations or restrictions;</li>
          <li>transfer your Bjorneo account (including Feedback) and user ID to another party without our consent;</li>

        <h3>Abusing Bjorneo</h3>
        <p>Bjorneo and its community of users (the "Community") work together to keep our sites, services, and tools working properly and the Community safe.

If you believe that your intellectual property rights have been violated, please notify our VeRO team through our Verified Rights Owner (VeRO) Program and we will investigate.</p>
        <p>Without limiting other remedies, we may, in our sole discretion, limit, suspend, or terminate our services and user accounts, prohibit access to our sites, services, and tools, and their content, delay or remove hosted content, and take technical and legal steps to keep users from using our sites, services, or tools, if we think that they are creating problems or possible legal liabilities, infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties, or acting inconsistently with the letter or spirit of our policies (for example, and without limitation, shill bidding, conducting off-Bjorneo transactions, manipulating Feedback, circumventing temporary or permanent suspensions or harassing our employees or other users).  We also reserve the right to cancel unconfirmed accounts or accounts that have been inactive for a long time, or to modify or discontinue Bjorneo sites, services, or tools.</p>
